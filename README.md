# Text to SVG

## Overview

The NLP-FL repository is used to implement an AI model that generats Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) from text. This model aims to provide an easy and efficient way to create SVG files, making it useful for various applications such as web design, graphic design, and data visualization.This model will avalable on ðŸ¤—

## Features

- **Text to SVG Conversion:** Easily convert plain text into SVG format.(coming soon on ðŸ¤—)
